We’ve tried to make it so that icons will take on the characteristics and appear alongside text naturally.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>Font Awesome is designed to be used with inline elements and we recommend sticking with a consistent HTML element to reference them by in your project. We like the <code class=\"inline\">&lt;i&gt;</code> tag for brevity and for the fact that most folks are using <code class=\"inline\">&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;</code> for emphasized/italicized semantic text these days. If that’s not your cup of tea, using a <code class=\"inline\">&lt;span&gt;</code> is more semantically correct.</p>\r\n    <p>\r\n      You need to know two bits of information to reference an icon, 1) its name, prefixed with fa- and 2. the style you want to use’s corresponding prefix.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <div v-highlight\r\n         style=\"width:100%;\">\r\n      <pre class=\"hljs my-pre\">\r\n         <code class=\"html\">\r\n            &lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;<!-- html代码需要转义 -->\r\n            &lt;i class=&quot;fas fa-camera&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt; &lt;!-- this icon&#x27;s 1) style prefix == fas and 2) icon name == camera --&gt;\r\n            &lt;i class=&quot;fas fa-camera&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt; &lt;!-- using an &lt;i&gt; element to reference the icon --&gt;\r\n            &lt;span class=&quot;fas fa-camera&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;!-- using a &lt;span&gt; element to reference the icon --&gt;\r\n          </code>\r\n      </pre>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <el-table :data=\"tableData\"\r\n              style=\"width: 100%;margin-top:0.5rem;\">\r\n      <el-table-column prop=\"Style\"\r\n                       label=\"Style\"\r\n                       width=\"180\">\r\n      </el-table-column>\r\n      <el-table-column prop=\"Availability\"\r\n                       label=\"Availability\"\r\n                       width=\"180\">\r\n      </el-table-column>\r\n      <el-table-column prop=\"StylePrefix\"\r\n                       label=\"Style Prefix\">\r\n      </el-table-column>\r\n      <el-table-column prop=\"Example\"\r\n                       label=\"Example\">\r\n      </el-table-column>\r\n      <el-table-column prop=\"Rendering\"\r\n                       label=\"Rendering\">\r\n      </el-table-column>\r\n    </el-table>\r\n    <el-divider></el-divider>\r\n    <span>The fa prefix has been deprecated in version 5.
